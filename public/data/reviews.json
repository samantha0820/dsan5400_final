It initially improved working memory (easier to take time to perform tasks such as not jumping ahead while reading), then, as it works on 2A receptors, created a DECREASED DESIRE to perform the tasks. Essentially, it lowers NE. So, lower motivation, which nearly completely negates the easier task performance. THIS IS A COMMON THREAD. Therefore, works better in conjunction with stims. It also created depersonalization. Finally, it caused a unique mixed episode with grandiosity and irritability, but psychomotor retardation and grumpiness. Think increased prefrontal, decreased limbic. Bipolars BEWARE. We are different than strict ADHD cases.",

The trade-off in the loss of almost all of her anxiety behaviors and her eagerness to now seek out activities and social interaction outside the house is amazing. We could not have achieved this without the close monitoring of her pediatrician. Our insurance does cover the generic at a very reasonable co-pay."
